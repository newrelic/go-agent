# New Relic Go Agent [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic/) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/newrelic/go-agent)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/newrelic/go-agent)

The New Relic Go Agent allows you to monitor your Go applications with New
Relic.  It helps you track transactions, outbound requests, database calls, and
other parts of your Go application's behavior and provides a running overview of
garbage collection, goroutine activity, and memory use.

Go is a compiled language, and doesnâ€™t use a virtual machine. This means that setting up New Relic for your Golang app requires you to use our Go agent API and manually add New Relic methods to your source code. Our API provides exceptional flexibility and control over what gets instrumented.  


## Compatibility and Requirements

For the latest version of the agent, Go 1.7+ is required, due to the use of `context.Context`.
(For versions 2.X and earlier of the Go agent, Go 1.3+ is required.)

Linux, OS X, and Windows (Vista, Server 2008 and later) are supported.


## Installing and using the Go agent

To install the agent, follow the instructions in our [GETTING_STARTED](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) 
document or our [GUIDE](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/GUIDE.md).  

We recommend instrumenting your Go code to get the maximum benefits from the 
New Relic Go agent. But we make it easy to get great data in couple of ways:

* Even without adding instrumentation, just importing the agent and creating an 
application will provide useful runtime information about your number of goroutines, 
garbage collection statistics, and memory and CPU usage.
* You can use our many [INTEGRATION packages](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/tree/master/v3/integrations) 
for out-of-the box support for many popular Go web frameworks and libraries. We 
continue to add integration packages based on your feedback. You can weigh in on 
potential integrations by opening an `Issue` here in our New Relic Go agent GitHub project.


## Upgrading

If you have already been using version 2.X of the agent and are upgrading to
version 3.0, see our [MIGRATION guide](MIGRATION.md) for details.


## Integration Packages

The following [integration packages](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations)
extend the base [newrelic](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic/) package
to support the following frameworks and libraries.
Frameworks and databases which don't have an integration package may still be
instrumented using the [newrelic](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic/)
package primitives.

## Runnable Example

[v3/examples/server/main.go](v3/examples/server/main.go) is an example that
will appear as "Example App" in your New Relic applications list.  To run it:

```
env NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__LICENSE__ \
    go run v3/examples/server/main.go
```

Some endpoints exposed are [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
and [http://localhost:8000/notice_error](http://localhost:8000/notice_error)
