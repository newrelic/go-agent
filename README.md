# New Relic Go Agent [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic/) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/newrelic/go-agent)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/newrelic/go-agent) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/newrelic/go-agent/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=UEWy0clWYW)](https://codecov.io/github/newrelic/go-agent)

The New Relic Go Agent allows you to monitor your Go applications with New
Relic. It helps you track transactions, outbound requests, database calls, and
other parts of your Go application's behavior and provides a running overview of
garbage collection, goroutine activity, and memory use.

Go is a compiled language, and doesnâ€™t use a virtual machine. This means that setting up New Relic for your Golang app requires you to use our Go agent API and manually add New Relic methods to your source code. Our API provides exceptional flexibility and control over what gets instrumented.

## Installation

### Compatibility and Requirements

For the latest version of the agent, Go 1.22+ is required.

Linux, OS X, and Windows (Vista, Server 2008 and later) are supported.

### Installing and using the Go agent

To install the agent, follow the instructions in our [GETTING_STARTED](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md)
document or our [GUIDE](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/GUIDE.md).

We recommend instrumenting your Go code to get the maximum benefits from the
New Relic Go agent. But we make it easy to get great data in couple of ways:

* Even without adding instrumentation, just importing the agent and creating an
application will provide useful runtime information about your number of goroutines,
garbage collection statistics, and memory and CPU usage.
* You can use our many [INTEGRATION packages](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/tree/master/v3/integrations)
for out-of-the box support for many popular Go web frameworks and libraries. We
continue to add integration packages based on your feedback. You can weigh in on
potential integrations by opening an `Issue` here in our New Relic Go agent GitHub project.

### Upgrading

If you have already been using version 2.X of the agent and are upgrading to
version 3.0, see our [MIGRATION guide](MIGRATION.md) for details.

## Getting Started

[v3/examples/server/main.go](v3/examples/server/main.go) is an example that
will appear as "Example App" in your New Relic applications list.  To run it:

```
env NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__LICENSE__ \
    go run v3/examples/server/main.go
```

Some endpoints exposed are [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
and [http://localhost:8000/notice_error](http://localhost:8000/notice_error)

## Usage

### Integration Packages

The following [integration packages](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations)
extend the base [newrelic](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic/) package
to support the following frameworks and libraries.
Frameworks and databases which don't have an integration package may still be
instrumented using the [newrelic](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic/)
package primitives.

### Alternatives

If you are already using another open source solution to gather telemetry data, you may find it easier to use one of our open source exporters to send this data to New Relic:

* OpenTelemetry: [github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go)
* OpenCensus: [github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opencensus-exporter-go)
* Prometheus Exporter: [github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus)
* Istio Adapter: [github.com/newrelic/newrelic-istio-adapter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-istio-adapter)
* Telemetry SDK: [github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-go)

## Go Agent Development

This section describes the suggested workflow for developers contributing to the Go Agent.

### The Makefile

At the root directory is a Makefile that contains several helpful targets for building containers and running tests.

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a useful development tool that allows for the quick, easy and repeatable creation of virtual environments.

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) builds on the functionality provided by Docker to control the orchestration of multi-container environments.

The development workflow described in this section relies heavily Docker. The containers that are generated will create a [volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) mounted to the current directory on the local host, allowing the modification of code and tests on the local host to be propagated automatically to the running container without having to re-build or copy manually.

### Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `devenv-image` | Build the dev image(s) specified under the `docker compose` `dev` profile. |
| `dev-shell` | Run `docker compose` with the `dev` profile. Open a shell in the running container. |
| `dev-stop`  | Terminate the running containers under the `docker compose` `dev` profile. |
| `test-services-start` | Spin up agent and other containers. |
| `test-services-stop`  | Terminate agent and other containers. |
| `core-test`  | Run a specified core test. |
| `core-suite` | Run all core tests. |
| `integration-test`  | Run a specified integration test. |
| `integration-suite` | Run all integration tests. |
| `tidy` | Replace github.com New Relic Go Agent Module with the local copy; run `go mod tidy`. |
| `info` | Display information about the running Go environment, integration tests, and core tests. |

### Usage

Build and run the agent container and database container(s). Execute a shell into the agent container environment:
```
make dev-shell
```

Terminate the container(s) started by `dev-shell`:
```
make dev-stop
```

Spin up services for testing. Does not create a shell into the container.
May specify an optional `PROFILE` argument to start another container not covered by the default `test` profile:
*Note*: When running the `integration-suite` against `test-services` containers, all accessory `PROFILE`s must be specified or the tests will fail.
This may require editing the docker-compose.yml file. It is recommended to instead use `dev-shell` for this kind of use case, as the `dev` profile will start every integration container by default.
```
make test-services-start <PROFILE=profile-name>
```

Terminate the containers started by the `test-services-start` target:
```
make test-services-stop <PROFILE=profile-name>
```

Run a core test. May specify optional `COVERAGE` argument to generate a coverprofile:
```
make core-test TEST=test-name <COVERAGE=1>
```

Run all core tests:
```
make core-suite <COVERAGE=1>
```

Run an integration test. May specify optional `COVERAGE` argument to generate a coverprofile:
```
make integration-test TEST=test-name <COVERAGE=1>
```

Run all integration tests:
```
make integration-suite <COVERAGE=1>
```

### Example (dev-shell)

An example development workflow where the developer is testing changes to `utilization` functionality and the `nrpgx5` integration might look like the following:

From the top-level checkout of the go-agent, start the containers and open a shell into the agent container:
```
local:go-agent user$ make dev-shell
[+] Building 0/0
...Docker build output...
[+] Building 1/1 docker.io/library/go-agent-devenv                                   0.0s
 âœ” Service devenv  Built                                                             0.8s
docker compose --profile dev up --pull missing --remove-orphans -d
[+] Running 2/2
 âœ” Container go-agent-postgres-1  Started                                            0.2s
 âœ” Container go-agent-devenv-1    Started                                            0.2s
docker compose exec -it devenv bash -c "bash"
root@5a832b6fcba3:/usr/src/app/go-agent#
```

Testing the `utilization` package:
```
root@5a832b6fcba3:/usr/src/app/go-agent# make core-test TEST=internal/utilization

# TEST=internal/utilization, COVERAGE=
go: downloading packages...
PASS
ok      github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/internal/utilization    0.116s
# TEST=internal/utilization
root@5a832b6fcba3:/usr/src/app/go-agent#
```

Testing the `nrpgx5` integration:
```
root@5a832b6fcba3:/usr/src/app/go-agent# make integration-test TEST=nrpgx5

# TEST=nrpgx5, COVERAGE=
go: downloading packages...
PASS
ok      github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrpgx5     1.100s
# TEST=nrpgx5
root@5a832b6fcba3:/usr/src/app/go-agent#
```
Make the necessary code changes, and test using the steps above until satisfied.

Once done with development, terminate the running containers:
```
root@5a832b6fcba3:/usr/src/app/go-agent# exit
exit
local:go-agent user$ make dev-stop
docker compose --profile dev stop
[+] Stopping 2/2
 âœ” Container go-agent-devenv-1    Stopped                                           10.1s
 âœ” Container go-agent-postgres-1  Stopped                                            0.1s
local:go-agent user$
```

### Example (test-services)

The `test-services-*` targets are designed to allow developers to run tests without needing to execute a shell into the agent container. Re-using the scenario described above in `dev-shell`, this workflow might look like the following:

From the top-level checkout of the go-agent:
```
local:go-agent user$ make test-services-start PROFILE=nrpgx5
[+] Pulling 16/16
 âœ” go Skipped - No image to be pulled                                                0.0s
 âœ” postgres Pulled                                                                   7.0s
...Docker build output...
 âœ” Service go                     Built                                              0.9s
 âœ” Container nr-go                Healthy                                            1.1s
 âœ” Container go-agent-postgres-1  Healthy                                            1.1s
local:go-agent user$
```
*Note*: the specification of `PROFILE=nrpgx5`. This ensures that the postgres container is started alongside the agent container in order to test the `nrpgx5` integration. This is not necessary if you do not intend to run postgres tests.

Testing the `utilization` package:
```
local:go-agent user$ docker exec -e TEST=internal/utilization nr-go make core-test

# TEST=internal/utilization, COVERAGE=
go: downloading packages...
PASS
ok      github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/internal/utilization    0.105s
# TEST=internal/utilization
local:go-agent user$
```
Let's quickly break down the above docker command:
1. [docker exec](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/exec/) executes a command in a running container.
2. `-e TEST=internal/utilization` passes the `TEST` argument as an environment variable.
3. `nr-go` is the name of the container where the command will be executed.
4. `make core-test` is the command to be executed.

The same logic applies to running integration tests:
```
local:go-agent user$ docker exec -e TEST=nrpgx5 nr-go make integration-test

# TEST=nrpgx5, COVERAGE=
go: downloading packages...
PASS
ok      github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrpgx5     1.095s
# TEST=nrpgx5
local:go-agent user$
```

Like the `dev-shell` target, the `test-services` agent container is volume-mounted to the local working directory containing the agent checkout. Code and test changes can be made and will automatically propagate to the container environment.

To terminate the running containers:
```
local:go-agent user$ make test-services-stop PROFILE=nrpgx5
[+] Stopping 2/2
 âœ” Container go-agent-postgres-1  Stopped                                            0.1s
 âœ” Container nr-go                Stopped                                           10.1s
local:go-agent user$
```

### Adding new tests or moving existing tests

When adding or moving tests, any changes must be reflected in the corresponding `integration-tests.mk` / `core-tests.mk` files.

`core-tests.mk` contains all tests under the `v3/newrelic` and `v3/internal` directories and subdirectories.

`integration-tests.mk` contains all tests under the `v3/integrations` directory and subdirectories.

### Development with different Go Versions

Docker Compose uses the latest Go Version for the agent container by default. At the time of writing, this is `1.24`. This value can be changed by exporting a `GO_VERSION` environment variable or top-level `.env` file containing the `GO_VERSION` definition.

Example using Go 1.23:
```
export GO_VERSION=1.23
```
Then start docker services as normal.
