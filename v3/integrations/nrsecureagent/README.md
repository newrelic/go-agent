# Renamed
In some early pre-release builds, there was an integration called `nrsecureagent`.
This has now been renamed to `nrsecurityagent`. 
In case any documentation directed you to the old name, please use the new name instead and report an issue to correct the outdated reference in the documentation which still has the old name.
